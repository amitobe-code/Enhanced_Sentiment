"This was one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. I bought it for the second track, 'Up Jumped the Devil'. I couldn't even get through it past track 3. The intro was awful. Just horrible, droning nonsense for three or so miserable unending minutes. I made it to the third song and it was as bad as the first. I couldn't take any more. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who values their ears or brain.",0.955656415

"Unfortunately the options of ""no stars"" is not in existence. This crap does not even deserve the one star. If you thought the books were bad, you were dead wrong. Horrible acting, disgusting plot line and forced action (which doesn't exist really).",0.954688017

"This CD is a huge disappointment! Why did they put crap on it and no Jimmy Hendrix or Bob Dylan, aside from his duet with Joan Osborn, which, in my oppinion, stinks. I am so glad I looked at the artists before I bought this sucker.",0.953548852
