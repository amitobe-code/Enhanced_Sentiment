2100,"Bette Midler is a wonderful talent and this album proves that (as if it hadn't already been proven!). She has a wonderful ear for great material and that also is shown on this great album. Tackling Teddy Pendergrass' LOVE TKO is no easy feat and the Divine Miss M doesn't disappoint, offering a compassionate take on a fabulous song.Having heard Lalah Hathaway and Joe Sample's version of ""When Your Life Was Low"" and loving the song as I do, I was interested in how Bette would approach the song which is steeped in jazz vocal. Her voice is amazing on this song and it makes you long for a sugar-free radio wave that would send this tune through stereo speakers everywhere.This album offers great songs and a Bette Midler that is in excellent voice and at her interpretive best. How wonderful it is for us to have Bette on TV, in the movies and in our CD players. She is truly one of the greatest talents we have, and as I said earlier, this album proves that!",0.9636013930078149

746,"X-Clan's full body of work is incredible. Once again they are at the top of their game with this album for the ages. Simply put, this album is perfect and fits right in with everything they have put out. Xodus was X-Clan's 2nd effort and the last album before the band split ways. While almost the entire group has since passed on to the crossroads, Brotha J is still going strong... and nowhere is he stronger than on this album. His lines are delivered with such inflection that you can almost see his face as you listen. The lyrics are deep and touch on important themes of our times in only the way that X-Clan could deliver. The production is great. What I like the most about this album is that it is very spiritual. In my opinion, this is the most primal and spiritual of any X-Clan album. Brotha J is the greatest. Oh... you gotta get this! A classic. 5 stars? This should get a zillion stars.",0.9632431819979869

I have 5 of her cd's and I like nothing better to do than just lie back and relax and listen to her music. When I hear her voice and the music, I few that I am being trasported to a different land far from where I presently am. I have to say, it is her voice that truly stands out on her albums. Some have compared her toBillie Holiday, and I think that might be a fair comparison. I can't think of any weak spots on this album, each songs is just so great.

The selections represent most of the song book that he played in his late career.The whole trio plays very well behind him. These recordings were made at the Monmarte in Denmark.Get all three before they are gone. You will not regret it. i had them on LP from the 1970's, and I paid more for them back then--especially volumes 2 and 3 which I had to import from England.There are approximately 5-7 volumes of Monmartre recordings of Dexter Gordon from the late 60's that are great too!",0.9623794536829602

The original collection must have been large already, but the wonder of compact disc has expanded ODDS AND SODS to 23 songs worth of hidden treasures that might otherwise be overlooked. The few songs on here from the aborted LIFEHOUSE project are proof that Pete Townshend was on to something back in 1971, he just didn't know how to present it to the public. 30 years later, with LIFEHOUSE about to come to fruition in a different form, these songs are excellent preparations for what could be the greatest rock show the world has ever seen!

The 15"" display is beautiful, the ATI Radeon 9000 allows you to play the latest games, and the build quality is excellent (these Powerbooks are made by the same company that makes high end Dell laptops). In my mind this is the only G4 to get. At 1GHz you have more than enough cpu horsepower, however if you start going much below this, the venerable G4 starts to show its age. I strongly suggest you don't buy a Powerbook unless you can afford at least an 800MHz machine (and that is entry level only!). I also feel Apple should reduce the price on these by a third. I know from my job pretty much dead on what they pay to have them built, and it is *well* below a grand. I think a 200%+ markup is not warranted. You could buy a much more powerful P4 system for this money (of course then you're stuck with Windows). Apple should try to be a little more competitive.",0.9615144535946892

2898,"This album was definitely a banger from start to finish. They came heavy with the club bangers in the beginning and smoothed it out in the end. The interludes were on point especially ""Q,Mike,Slim,Daron"" they killed it. Mike put his heart and soul on ""Missing You"" whoever was his girl definitely hit a chord. ""Dont Be Mad"" feat. Twista was definitely bout it with 112 talking about handling another dude's girl. That was a bold song. All the members really shined on this album as far as lead vocals, producing. You really see these gentlemen coming into their craft. Just wish they were still on Bad Boy because they fell off since they went to Def Jam. Good Luck in the future.",0.9610579070609397
